# Restaurant Reviews App
---
#### _Project 5 Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program - Mobile Web Specialist_

## Project Overview:

For this project, I incrementally converted a [static webpage](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) to a mobile-ready web application. The base code provided a static design that lacked accessibility and I made it responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Finally, I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience.

### Experiencing the app

You can experience the Restraunt Reviews App by clicking [here](https://chase-owens.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/) or by opening a simple server.

To spin up a simple server, navigate to the folder through the terminal and follow these instructions:

1. In the terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to experience the app.

I enjoyed learning about A11y and implementing a Service Worker.
Thanks for checking it out,
