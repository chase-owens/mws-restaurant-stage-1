# Restaurant Reviews App

#### _Project 5 Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program - Mobile Web Specialist_

## Project Overview

For this project, Udacity scholars were provide with this [source code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). This base code provided a static design that lacked accessibility. The challenge was to make it responsive on different sized displays, accessible for screen reader use, and to include a service worker for a seamless offline experience.

### Experiencing the app

You can experience the Restaurant Reviews App by clicking [here](https://chase-owens.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-1/) or by opening a simple server.

To spin up a simple server, navigate to the folder through the terminal and follow these instructions:

1. In the terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to experience the app.

I enjoyed learning about A11y and implementing a Service Worker.
Thanks for checking it out,
